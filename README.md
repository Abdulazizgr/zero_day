# Zero Day

This is my first repository as a full-stack engineer. It is part of the zero_day project for ALX School.

The "zero_day" repository is a simple project that demonstrates how to create a new repository on GitHub.com, configure your basic info on your local machine, and push your first file to the remote server.

The project includes a single file called "README.md", which contains a brief introduction to the project and the steps required to set it up. The README file is written in Markdown format, which makes it easy to read and edit.

By completing this project, I have gained valuable experience with Git and GitHub, and I am now ready to tackle more complex projects as a full-stack engineer.
